I've played around with various blogging solutions in the past, but nothing has really stuck. Here goes yet another attempt. The idea here is that I'd like to see a list of repos and recent commits that will jog my mind and give me a starting point for describing some problem I worked on. I'll write content in markdown and save to Azure blob storage. By seeing commit info while writing, I'll be able to link to the relevant source easily. When I link a blog post to one or more commits, those will disappear from my list so I won't try to write about them again.

I started a [Blazor App](https://github.com/adamfoneil/CodeBlogger/tree/master/CodeBlogger.App) for this, but I realized right away that I needed a [GitHubAPI Client](https://github.com/adamfoneil/CodeBlogger/blob/master/CodeBlogger.Services/GitHubClient.cs) first. So this is what I started on, and I have [basics of this](https://github.com/adamfoneil/CodeBlogger/blob/master/CodeBlogger.Tests/GitHubIntegration.cs) working.
